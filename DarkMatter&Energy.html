		<h2 id = "intro"> Introduction </h2>
		<p>
			It may sound difficult to believe, but our ordinary matter only makes up 5% of the known universe. 
			So what makes up the other 95% of the universe?
			Most people would just say "empty space", but that is not exactly true.
			In fact scientists believe that there is little to no empty space in the universe at all.
			We believe that the universe is:
		</p>
			<ul>
				<li> 68% Dark Energy </li>
				<li> 27% Dark Matter </li>
				<li> 5% Matter </li>
			</ul> 
		<p>
			But why so?
			And how do we know all this?
			Well, lets find out.
		</p>
		<h2 id = "Energy"> What is Dark Energy? </h2>
		<p>
			Dark Energy is purely theoretical force that is supposedly pulling the universe apart.
			Scientist predict it will result in our inevitable destruction in its current conflict with gravity.
			More on that on <a href = "UniverseEnd.html">my other site</a>.
			Scientists predict the Universe is comprised of 68% Dark Energy,
			taking up the majority of the volume.
		</p>
		<h2  id = "HowE"> How do we know Dark Energy Exists? </h2>
		<p>
			We know dark energy exists because the universe is constantly expanding.
			Scientists have predicted that the universe should start squishing together and then ultimately collapse in on itself
			due to the overwhelming force of gravity.
			However, they were astonished when they found that the universe was in fact expanding. 
			They observed many stars and galaxies moving away from each other.
			This meant that there was some force acting against gravity, and winning.
			None of the <a href = "FourFundamentalForces.html">Four Fundamental Forces</a>
			we know of have this property, so scientists named theis mysterious force "Dark Energy".
		</p>
		<h2  id = "Matter"> What is Dark Matter? </h2>
		<p>
			Dark Matter makes up 27% of the universe as we know it.
			It does not seem to interact with the <a href = "FourFundamentalForces.html">Electromagnetic Force</a>,
			which includes light.
			This means it is completely invisible to both the eye, whether naked or aided.
			We only know of it through its gravitational effects.
			But why?
			We predict it is because it is made up of "supersymmetric particles" - 
			theoretical particles that could be partners to the particles in our standard model of partile physics.
		</p>
		<h2 id = "HowM"> How do we know Dark Matter exists? </h2>
		<p> 
			With Dark Energy taking up 68%, and normal matter taking up 5%, what makes up the remaining 27%?
			Scientists have noticed that there was strange patches of gravity forming in certain areas we do not detect any other form of matter to be.
			There could be multiple causes for this.
			We know it couldn't be any form of normal matter since it is not absorbing any radiation.
			It also cannot be be antimatter since we do not detect any gamma rays produced by matter and the dark matter colliding.
			This only leaves a new type of matter, dark matter, as an option.
		</p>
		<h2  id= "Conclusion"> Conclusion </h2>
		<p>
			Dark Matter and Energy are just theoretical, 
			but in all honesty, what isn't?
			Someday something new might show up and completely change the way we see the universe.
			At that point, it would mean everything every scientist had done up to this point was a waste.
			But until then, this is the best understanding of the universe we have to this date,
			so we just have to keep trying, because a true scientist is never done.
